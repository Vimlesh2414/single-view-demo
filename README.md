## HDP Single view demo


#### Lab overview
In this lab we demonstrate how HDP sandbox can be used to build a single view of a product or customer

1. Start HDP 2.3 sandbox and enable Hive features like transactions, queues, preemption, Tez and sessions
2. Sqoop - import CRM/ERP data from DB/EDW into Hive 
3. Nifi/Flume - Import simulated web traffic logs into Hive
4. Nifi/Storm - import related tweets into Hive  
5. Analyze tables to populate statistics
6. Use Hive view to correlate the data from multiple data sources
